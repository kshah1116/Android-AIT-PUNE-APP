    <string name="History">The college was set up when Gen B.C. Joshi, PVSM AVSM, ADC (1935â€“1994), the then Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army, saw the need for an engineering college for the children of all ranks of the Indian Army.\n His view was that children of army personnel were disadvantaged as far as education was concerned due to the direct consequence of soldiers serving under difficult conditions in remote areas where educational facilities are not always available. \nAdditionally, the regular movement of army personnel, potentially across the country, affects the continuity of education. \n AIT was formally inaugurated by Gen S.Roy Chaudhary PVSM, ADC on 24th Feb, 1995. \nThe first batch of students graduated in 1998. The succeeding batches continue to excel in all fields - be it sports, cultural or academics./nBeautiful campus, serene ambience and architectural splendor,state of the art infrastructure, all provide vital ingredients for a delectable academic environment for development of total quality engineers. And this tradition of excellence continues with every new batch coming to the Institution.</string>
