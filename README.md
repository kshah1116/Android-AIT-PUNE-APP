App developed for AIT Pune,(APP DEV Contest)


**Army Institute Of technology Application**<br/>
<br/>
**Problem Statement:** <br/>
Each and every institute has its website,but its rare for a college to have its own Application.But guess what? We are here to present our application for our esteemed institute
"Army Institute Of technology".<br/>
Our Application is directed towards solving the most faced dilemma for new comers,that is where  they will find the information about Academics,Clubs,Facilities,Scholarships and most importantly 'honest reviews about a college'.The notion which is created when we read the reviews from various websites isn't always the reality.
<br/>
<br/>
**Proposed Solution:**<br/>
Our basic motive was to provide a simple and efficient app for students.Our app starts with the **HOME** page that includes the overview and history of our beloved institute this page also contains a youtube video which gives a sneak peak inside AIT.<br/>
Next we have **ACADEMICS**.The academics gives you insight into the departments of our college with name of our respected Head of departments.<br/>
Now comes the most awaited part **"LIFE OF AITIANS"**. This gives an overview of events, sports ,cafeteria, library and hostels.<br/>
Next comes the fun part,**CLUBS**.This familiarize us with the boards, clubs and club secretaries.<br/>
Now comes the informative part **SCHOLARSHIPS** which helps students to get instant information about every scholarship provided through AIT.<br/>
The **RESEARCH** page gives Vision,Mission and the Objectives promoting the value of research.<br/>
For honest reviews Aitians have to **LOGIN** using email provided by institute and submit their respective views in **REVIEW** page.<br/>

**Functionality & Concepts used :**
Our App has a very soothing and attractive design, is simple and interactive too which makes our app user friendly.Our aim was to provide simplicity at its best so that students can easily gather the required knowledge.
<br/>
Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :
<br/>
ðŸŸ£Frame Layout:We have used the FrameLayout  to hold a single child view, because it can be difficult to organize child views in a way that's scalable to different screen sizes without the children overlapping each other.
<br/>
ðŸŸ£Horizontal Scroll View: To make the picture more dynamic.We have used it in the welcome card at the top of the Home Page as well as In sports,hostels,cafe in life At AIt.
<br/>
ðŸŸ£Changed the default app icon: We changed the icon of our app to AIT logo using manifest.
<br/>
ðŸŸ£Changed the app theme and added Gradient Bankground(using a new XML File and specifying start and end color): For consistent application of colors throughout the app.
<br/>
ðŸŸ£CardView:We have used cards to enhance the look of our app's UI.
<br/>
ðŸŸ£Navigation Drawer and Drawer Layout: For easy  navigation  between different screens.DrawerLayout acts as a top-level container for window content that allows for interactive "drawer" views to be pulled out from one or both vertical edges of the window.
<br/>
ðŸŸ£Connect To The Internet :Connected to internet using Manifest.
<br/>
ðŸŸ£Youtube API player (from Github): To Play our college's Movie so that everyone can get a sneak peek!!!!
<br/>
ðŸŸ£Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages.
<br/>
<br/>
**Application Link & Future Scope :**
The app is currently in the Alpha testing phase with a limited no. of users, You can access the app : https://github.com/kshah1116/AIT-Pune-Application.git
<br/>
Our Future scopes include: Linking the Login Page and the review submission page so that only AITians having proper Email can give there honest reviews.Also create a screen to display these reviews.We also would like to add a to do list and creating link between the scholarship buttons and pdf's of respective scholarship so that students can access this easily.
